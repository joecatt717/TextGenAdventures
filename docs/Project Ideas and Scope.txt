The general project idea is as follows:

Part 1:
Create a Parsing system that can accurately determine user input as a noun, verb, adjective etc.
Make this system as streamlined as possible to ensure that the user is not pulled out of the experience with clarification questions.

Part 2:
Create a complex text adventure game that runs using the Parsing system.
This is in large part to test the parsing system's functionality.

Part 3:
Create a simple web and/or mobile app to contain the text adventure, and allow people to play the game free of charge.
Be sure to implement any feedback acrued this way.

Part 4:
Expand the scope of the application by creating a second and possibly third text adventure.
Expand the Parsing system to include items from all three adventures.

Part 5:
Create an input system that generates text adventures, based on simple user inputs.
i.e. describe the room - map it...
what is in the room - create those items in the game_space

Part 6:
Test it, and alter the program based on player feedback.
